# CLAT Chatbot

This project is a simple rule-based or NLP-powered chatbot that answers CLAT-related queries. It is built using **spaCy** for NLP processing and **Streamlit** for the web interface. The chatbot answers queries like:

- "What is the syllabus for CLAT 2025?"
- "How many questions are there in the English section?"
- "Give me last year’s cut-off for NLSIU Bangalore."

## Features

- **Query-based Responses**: The chatbot accepts user queries and responds with relevant answers based on a predefined knowledge base or FAQs.
- **Streamlit Interface**: The chatbot is deployed as a web app using Streamlit.
- **NLP Model**: Uses spaCy for basic natural language processing to understand and respond to queries.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Libraries:
  - spaCy
  - Streamlit

Knowledge Base
The chatbot uses a small knowledge base of CLAT-related queries. You can expand or modify this knowledge base by editing the relevant files in the data/ folder or updating the response logic in the app.py file.

How to Use
Open the Streamlit app by navigating to the folder and running streamlit run app.py.

Type your query related to CLAT (e.g., "What is the syllabus for CLAT 2025?").

The chatbot will return a relevant answer based on its training or a keyword-based search.
